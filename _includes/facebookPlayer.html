<!-- NOTE: Facebook requires you to import their script, probably for tracking. Who knows. 
           Make sure you're okay with doing this otherwise don't use this method! 
           Also note, we don't use the CSS container which we used for other providers such as
           Youtube since FB handles it on their own -->
