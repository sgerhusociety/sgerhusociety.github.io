Wang Fang Liang is an outstanding Erhu performer and a highly respected member of the Chinese music community.  He is the Honorary Director of the Chinese Folk Music Association (China), the Honorary Advisor of the Erhu Society of China, and a member of the Chinese Musicians’ Association (China).  Now based in Singapore, Wang teaches the Erhu at the Music Department of the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, and the Gifted Young Chinese Instrumentalists Course at its School of Young Talents.  He is also the President of the Erhu Society (Singapore).

At age 17, Wang was admitted to the Chinese Folk Music Faculty of the Xi’an Conservatory of Music and studied under the famous Erhu virtuoso and pedagogue Professor Lu Ri Rong.  Since then, he was won a string of accolades for his Erhu performance.  These include first prizes at the Xi’an Conservatory’s Erhu Competition in 1980 and the China National Folk Music Solo Performance Competition in 1982, outstanding performance prizes at the Guangdong Music Competition in 1986 and Shanxi Folk Music Competition in 1987, second prize in the Erhu section of the Shancheng Cup Folk Music Competition organised by China’s Central Television in 1989 and first prizes for both composition and performance in the China National Folk Music Competition in 1991.

He has also performed as soloist and principal player in major concerts and performances across China.  In 1995, at the invitation of the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, Wang performed to much acclaim as a soloist at the concert commemorating the 100th birth anniversary of Erhu virtuoso Liu Tian Hua.  More recently, Wang has been invited to speak and perform in various Asian countries, including Hong Kong and Malaysia.  These appearances have been well-received by the international audience.
